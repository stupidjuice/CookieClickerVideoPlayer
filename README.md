# Instructions
##### Step 1) Add frames to the "frames" folder
Make sure they follow the same naming scheme as the Bad Apple sample
You can use a tool like ffmpeg or any video editing software to split the frames into seperate images (I used Blender)

##### Step 2) Open index.html
It will take a long time to load


##### Step 3) Open Console in inspect element
Right click > Inspect Element > Console

##### Step 4) Open processer.py

##### Step 5) Start processing frames
Type "PlayVideo();" in the inspect element console. This will start processing the video. You can check the processer.py window to check the progress of the processing. Once processing is done, the final frame of the video will open

##### Step 6) Enjoy!
The animation will start playing automatically, so just close the window showing the final frame, and just watch.
